      "text": "With the proliferation of new technologies available to homeowners, residential cabling will have to be upgraded to match these advances. Consumer products such as WebTV, Internet Phone, and games over the Internet will require wiring to handle the amount of information traveling through them. The standard home today uses wiring designed 50 years ago for applications that did not exist at that time. Homes must be wired for the requirements of today's homeowners as well as for products not yet designed."
